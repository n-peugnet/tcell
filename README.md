This is a fork of [gdamore/tcell](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell) that
includes bracketed pastes and other improvements from [zyedidia's fork](https://github.com/zyedidia/tcell)
and also adds support for strikethrough and italic text.

Primarily made for use with [mauview](https://github.com/tulir/mauview), which
was designed for [gomuks](https://github.com/tulir/gomuks).
